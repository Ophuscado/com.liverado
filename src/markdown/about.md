# About

In 2020, Liverado open-source project started as an encrypted email service created to protect people's privacy by design, and its technology is committed to protect mailboxes from malware, phishing, spam, spyware, and surveillance, by employing the latest security trends such as end-to-end encryption messaging and end-to-end encrypted file storage.

Privacy is a fundamental human right, and we believe in the power of encryption technology to protect peoples' digital life. We work all around the clock to develop and maintain a platform that fights for preserving free speech and online privacy. Liverado keeps your data encrypted and protected from the major threat models by merging solid encryption algorithms and the latest security trends in the IT industry.

Liverado allows you to delete your data immediately through normal service interactions upon your request. You decide when your data is shredded.

This advantage applies to our zero logs policy too. We passively reduce your metadata and logging information to the minimum technically required, aiming to prevent unintentional data leaks from our customers. Your IP address is always protected and hidden when using our services.

The development and maintenance is entirely self-financed. Currently, our operation is entirely supported by the members' initial contributions and paid users. The service is entirely ad-free and never performs big data analysis. Therefore, your identities and communications are never processed by artificial intelligence in our systems nor shared with third parties.

Now, we are standing firm in defending your online privacy and security for a bright future.

### The story behind the name "Liverado"

"Liverado" is a word in the Esperanto language. The accepted meanings are "Delivery" and "Supply". The name is derived from the Latin word "Liver", which means "blood", and "Vado", which means "to go".

Esperanto is the most widely used international auxiliary language in the world, created in 1887 by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof. It is the only language whose mother tongue is its mother tongue. It aims to become a universal second language for international communication.

The word "Esperanto" is translated into English as "one who hopes"; people who speak Esperanto are usually called "Esperantos". Although no country officially adopts Esperanto, Esperantujo is used as the name of a collection of places where Esperanto is spoken.

Liverado teammates are the people with hope. We hope to deliver every message with our world-class service. We hope everyone can enjoy privacy as a fundamental human right.
